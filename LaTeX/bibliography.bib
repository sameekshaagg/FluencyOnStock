abstract = {This research focuses on branding strategies for new products. Meaningful brand names (those that suggest a positive attribute or benefit of the product) are typically evaluated more favorably on overall liking and are easier to recall than non-meaningful brand names. The study reported here is the first such investigation of evaluation of brand names over repeated exposure. Of particular interest are differences in the extent to which meaningful versus non-meaningful brand names benefit from repeated exposure. Results of the study show that meaningful brand names continue to be evaluated more favorably than non-meaningful names, even after repeated exposure, but that evaluations of non-meaningful brand names may improve at a greater rate than those for meaningful brand names. The brand names also influence evaluations of quality and other product attributes. Implications of the research for branding strategies in both domestic and international markets are discussed.}

    abstract = { Psychological research suggests that individuals are satisficers. That is, when confronted with a large number of options, individuals often choose the first acceptable option, rather than the best possible option ( Simon, 1957 ). Given the vast quantity of information available and the widespread convention of listing stocks in alphabetical order, we conjecture that investors are more likely to buy and sell stocks with early alphabet names. Consistent with this view, we find that early alphabet stocks are traded more frequently than later alphabet stocks and that alphabeticity also affects firm value. We also document how these effects have changed over time. },

Consistent with fluency affecting investment decisions, we find that companies with short, easy to pronounce names have higher breadth of ownership, greater share turnover, lower transaction price impacts, and higher valuation ratios. Corporate name changes increase fluency on average, and fluency-improving name changes are associated with increases in breadth of ownership, liquidity, and firm value. Name fluency also affects other investment decisions, with fluently named closed-end funds trading at smaller discounts and fluent mutual funds attracting greater fund flows.}

Central to the MLP model is the use of neurons with nonlinear and differentiable activation functions. The most commonly used activation function is a sigmoidal function, and frequently all neurons in an MLP network employ the same activation function. In this paper, we introduce the notion of the generalized sigmoid as an activation function for neurons in the output layer of an MLP network. The enhancements afforded by the use of the generalized sigmoid are analyzed and demonstrated in the context of some well-known classification problems.}

abstract = { Processing fluency, or the subjective experience of ease with which people process information, reliably influences people’s judgments across a broad range of social dimensions. Experimenters have manipulated processing fluency using a vast array of techniques, which, despite their diversity, produce remarkably similar judgmental consequences. For example, people similarly judge stimuli that are semantically primed (conceptual fluency), visually clear (perceptual fluency), and phonologically simple (linguistic fluency) as more true than their less fluent counterparts. The authors offer the first comprehensive review of such mechanisms and their implications for judgment and decision making. Because every cognition falls along a continuum from effortless to demanding and generates a corresponding fluency experience, the authors argue that fluency is a ubiquitous metacognitive cue in reasoning and social judgment. }
